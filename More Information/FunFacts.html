                <p>I have always loved playing video games. It has been one of the few entertaining and <br/>
                    enjoyable things. I don’t play as much as I used to because I want to focus on more <br/>
                    productive things, but It won’t be a hobby that I’ll discontinue; it will always be <br/>
                     one of my favorite things to do.

                    I didn’t start reading till after I graduated high school before that I thought reading <br/>
                     was useless and pointless. Once I devoted myself to trying to improve my life and learn <br/>
                      more I started to study different subjects and books. It has become one of the most productive <br/>
                       and entertaining hobbies. You can learn so much about the world and yourself just by exploring <br/>
                        and I think reading books is a great guide to that.

                    It's critical to maintain excellent physical health if you want to lead a high-quality life. <br/>
                    Without the ability to move, one can become a burden to their family and lifestyle. <br/>
                    Personally, I find strength and capability to be extremely empowering in any physical activity,<br/>
                     not to mention therapeutic.
